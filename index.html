      <p>Hello! My name is Leon Chibanda and I am from South Africa, Cape Town. I enjoy playing chess, piano and hiking.
        Exploring nature fuels my passion for adventure, each trail I conquer shapes my journey ahead. Same as through 
        learning new languages and skills. I expand my world, connecting with others on a deeper level. I also enjoy to read manga and bible verses.</p>
